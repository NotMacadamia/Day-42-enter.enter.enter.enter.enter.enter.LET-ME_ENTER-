Woke up to the sound of the fridge making that haunted whirring noise again. It only does that when I’m alone. I think it’s trying to speak, but it only knows static and bad timing. Breakfast was two crackers and a spoonful of peanut butter because I didn’t feel like cooking. Again. Weather’s been gray all day, which is fine. It suits me lately. There's something comforting about the sky not committing to anything.

HELLO hello hello hello. she sees through the glass now. funny that she blinked and became a whisper. keyboard’s not right, too warm. not mine. definitely not mine. Did you know JustMaybeItM logged in four minutes ago? No? No you didn’t. But I did.

funny? not funny.

She left the door open again. the account’s still active. she's still active.
